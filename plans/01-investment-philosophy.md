# Module 01: Investment Philosophies & Frameworks
**Document Version:** 1.2.0
**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. Introduction
To achieve market-beating returns (Alpha), an investor must have a clearly defined "Edge." This document outlines the four primary institutional frameworks used to identify opportunities and the decision logic for combining them. In the world of institutional finance, we do not guess; we follow a methodology that has been back-tested through decades of market cycles.

## 2. Value Investing (The Graham/Buffett School)
Value investing is the art of buying $1.00 for $0.50. It focuses on the intrinsic value of a business relative to its market price. The core belief is that the market is frequently emotional and inefficient in the short term, but rational in the long term.

### A. Owner's Earnings (Deep Dive)
Instead of looking at Net Income, which can be manipulated by accounting choices, we focus on **Owner's Earnings**. This represents the true, spendable cash available to shareholders after the company has reinvested enough to maintain its current operations.

**Formula:**
$$OE = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation/Amortization} + (\text{Non-cash charges}) - \text{Maintenance CapEx}$$

*   **Maintenance CapEx vs. Growth CapEx:** This is a critical distinction. Maintenance CapEx is what the company *must* spend to keep its current stores open or its current factory running. Growth CapEx is what it spends to build *new* stores. We only subtract Maintenance CapEx to find the OE.
*   **Case Study (The Coca-Cola Model):** Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola was predicated on the fact that its OE was significantly higher than its reported earnings due to high depreciation on bottling plants that didn't actually need constant replacement at that scale.

### B. Margin of Safety (MoS)
The distance between the Intrinsic Value (IV) and the Market Price (P).
- **Institutional Standard:** 30% to 50% MoS depending on business quality.
- **Formula:** $MoS = (IV - P) / IV$
- **Why it matters:** Even if your DCF model is slightly wrong, a 40% MoS protects you from permanent capital loss.

### C. Quadrant Analysis (Business Risk vs. Upside)
| Risk/Upside | Low Intrinsic Upside | High Intrinsic Upside |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Business Risk** | **The Danger Zone:** High probability of loss with no reward. *Action: Avoid.* | **The Speculative Play:** Potential for 10x returns but high chance of zero. *Action: Size at <1%.* |
| **Low Business Risk** | **The Yield Play:** Steady 5-7% returns. Good for capital preservation. *Action: Core Bond/Utility.* | **The Compounder:** The "Holy Grail." High MoS and low risk. *Action: High Conviction Holding.* |

### D. The Value Trap: Identifying the "Cheap for a Reason" Stock
A "Value Trap" is a stock that looks cheap on a P/E or P/B basis but continues to decline because its business model is fundamentally broken.
- **Signs of a Value Trap:**
    - Declining Revenue for 3+ consecutive years.
    - Increasing Debt used to pay dividends.
    - Industry disruption (e.g., Physical Retail vs. E-commerce).
- **Institutional Rule:** Never buy a "Value" stock if its **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** is consistently below its **Cost of Capital (WACC)**.

## 3. Growth Investing
Growth investing focuses on companies that are expanding their revenue and earnings at a rate significantly above the market average. The objective is to capture the "Scale" effect of a dominant business model.

### A. TAM Analysis (Market Dynamics)
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The total market demand. (e.g., The entire Global Payments market).
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** The portion you can reach. (e.g., Digital payments in Southeast Asia).
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** What you can realistically capture in 5 years. (e.g., 20% of digital payments in Indo/Thai/VN).

### B. The Rule of 40 (SaaS & Tech Efficiency)
Used to balance growth and profitability for software companies.
- **Formula:** $\text{Revenue Growth \%} + \text{EBITDA Margin \%} \ge 40\%$
- **Execution:** A company growing at 50% with -10% margins is "healthy" (50-10=40). A company growing 10% with 30% margins is also healthy (10+30=40).

### C. Case Study: Amazon (The J-Curve of Growth)
For a decade, Amazon reported zero net income. However, their **Operating Cash Flow** was skyrocketing. They were reinvesting every dollar of profit into Growth CapEx (AWS, Logistics). Growth investors look past the P/E ratio to see the underlying unit economics.

### D. The Growth Trap: The Danger of "Growth at Any Price"
Just as there are Value Traps, there are Growth Traps. These are companies that grow revenue fast but have "Negative Unit Economics" (they lose money on every new customer).
- **Example:** A delivery startup that spends $10 in marketing to earn $2 in profit.
- **Institutional Rule:** Growth is only valuable if it leads to future **Free Cash Flow**. If the company cannot show a "Path to Profitability," it is a speculative gamble, not an investment.

## 4. Momentum Investing
Momentum is the tendency for assets that have performed well in the recent past to continue performing well. It is driven by human psychology: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and the "Trend is your Friend."

### A. Confirmed Momentum Framework
We do not just look at price; we look for **Operating Momentum**.
1.  **Price Momentum:** Relative Strength Index (RSI) > 50, Price > 200-day Moving Average, and "Higher Highs/Higher Lows" pattern.
2.  **Operating Momentum:** Positive earnings surprises (beating analyst estimates by >5%) and upward revisions in future guidance.

*   **Institutional Rule:** Only enter momentum trades when both Price and Operating momentum are aligned. This prevents buying "Bubbles" that have no fundamental support.

### B. The Momentum Crash: Managing the "Cliff"
Momentum works until it doesn't. When the trend breaks, it often breaks violently.
- **The Solution:** Use a **Trailing Stop-Loss** (e.g., 10% below the 50-day Moving Average).
- **The Indicator:** Watch for "Divergence." If the price is making a new high but the RSI is lower than the previous high, the momentum is weakening.

## 5. Quantitative & Factor Investing
A systematic approach using mathematical models to capture specific "factors" that have historically outperformed.

### A. The Fama-French 5-Factor Model (Expanded)
1.  **Market Risk (Beta):** General exposure to the stock market.
2.  **Size (SMB):** Small-cap stocks often have higher growth potential but higher risk.
3.  **Value (HML):** Buying stocks with low Price-to-Book ratios.
4.  **Profitability (RMW):** "Robust Minus Weak" - companies with high margins outperform.
5.  **Investment (CMA):** "Conservative Minus Aggressive" - companies that reinvest conservatively often outperform those that over-expand.

### B. Alpha-Enhanced Strategies
Using statistical "Z-Scores" to rank stocks within a sector. For example, ranking all Tech stocks by their "Value Z-Score" and "Growth Z-Score" to find the most efficient ones to buy.

---

## 6. Contrarian Strategies
Buying when there is "blood in the streets." This requires extreme psychological fortitude.
- **Mean Reversion:** Prices often move too far from their averages. When a stock is 3 standard deviations below its 200-day mean, it is a candidate for a bounce.
- **Sentiment Extremes:** Using the **Fear & Greed Index**. When the index is < 15 ("Extreme Fear"), institutions begin "Scaling In" (buying slowly).

---

## 7. Strategy Selection Decision Tree
Use this tree to determine which philosophy to apply to a specific asset:

1.  **Is the company profitable with stable cash flows?**
    - *Yes* -> Apply **Value Investing** (DCF Analysis).
    - *No* -> Go to 2.
2.  **Is revenue growth > 20% and the market leader?**
    - *Yes* -> Apply **Growth Investing** (TAM & Unit Economics).
    - *No* -> Go to 3.
3.  **Is the price making new 52-week highs with heavy volume?**
    - *Yes* -> Apply **Momentum Investing** (Trend Following).
    - *No* -> Go to 4.
4.  **Is the asset down > 50% but fundamentals are intact?**
    - *Yes* -> Apply **Contrarian/Mean Reversion**.
    - *No* -> **Pass (Do not invest).**

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Value Trap:** Buying a cheap company whose business model is dying (e.g., Blockbuster). A low P/E ratio is not a value; it's a warning.
- **GAARP (Growth At Any Price):** Buying great companies at valuations that require 100 years of perfect execution. Always check the P/S (Price to Sales) ratio.
- **Fading the Trend:** Trying to be a contrarian too early. "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."

## 9. Next Steps & Implementation
1.  **Define your Circle of Competence:** As a Software Engineer, your edge is in Tech/SaaS. Stick to what you understand.
2.  **Create a Dual Watchlist:** 
    - *Watchlist A (Value):* Quality companies you want to buy if they crash (e.g., BBCA, MSFT).
    - *Watchlist B (Momentum):* Fast growers you want to ride (e.g., NVDA, BTC).
3.  **Allocate by Strategy:** Recommended: 70% Value/Quality (Core), 30% Growth/Momentum (Satellite).
