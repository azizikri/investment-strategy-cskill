# Module 08: Life Cycle Investment Strategy
**Document Version:** 1.1.0
**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. The Lifetime Portfolio Mandate
Institutional managers don't just invest for today; they manage according to the **Time Horizon** of the capital. For an individual, this means managing the transition from **Human Capital** (your future earning power) to **Financial Capital** (your current investment portfolio).

---

## 2. Human Capital vs. Financial Capital
- **Early Career (20s-30s):** Your Human Capital is massive (decades of IDR 7.2M+ monthly checks ahead). Your Financial Capital is small. You can afford to be 100% in Equities/Crypto because a 50% crash in your portfolio is easily "fixed" by one year of salary.
- **Late Career (50s-60s):** Your Human Capital is nearly exhausted. Your Financial Capital is high. A 50% crash is now catastrophic because you don't have enough "Salary Years" left to earn it back.

## 3. The Decade-by-Decade Glide Path

### A. The Experimental 20s (Accumulation Phase)
- **Goal:** Aggressive growth and skill acquisition.
- **Allocation:** 90% Equity / 10% Crypto/Alts.
- **Strategy:** Focus on **Max Drawdown Survival**. Learn how you react to volatility when your portfolio is small.
- **Key Action:** Invest in certifications/skills to double your monthly IDR 7.2M income.

### B. The Optimization 30s (Growth Phase)
- **Goal:** Scalability.
- **Allocation:** 80% Equity / 15% Bonds / 5% Alts.
- **Strategy:** Move from "Individual Picks" to the "Core-Satellite" model.
- **Key Action:** Minimize "Lifestyle Creep." As your salary grows, increase your **Savings Rate**, not your car size.

### C. The Peak 40s (Consolidation Phase)
- **Goal:** Building the "Critical Mass."
- **Allocation:** 70% Equity / 25% Bonds / 5% Cash.
- **Strategy:** Focus on **Quality and Dividends**. Look for assets that generate cash flow.
- **Key Action:** Maximize contributions to your Core. The compounding effect of 15 years is now very powerful.

### D. The De-Risking 50s (Preservation Phase)
- **Goal:** Avoiding "Sequence of Returns" Risk.
- **Allocation:** 50% Equity / 40% Bonds / 10% Cash.
- **Strategy:** Shift Satellite gains into the Core.
- **Key Action:** Plan your "Healthcare Buffer." In Indonesia, medical costs for seniors are a major risk to capital preservation.

## 4. Withdrawal Strategies: The Distribution Phase
Once you hit your **FI Number** (Financial Independence), you move from "Accumulation" to "Distribution."

### A. The 4% Rule (Adjusted for Indonesia)
Historically, a 4% withdrawal rate from a US portfolio survived a 30-year retirement. However, in Indonesia:
1.  **Inflation is higher:** You may need to lower the withdrawal rate to **3-3.5%**.
2.  **Currency Volatility:** If your portfolio is in USD (Gotrade) and you spend in IDR, a strong IDR could reduce your purchasing power.
3.  **The Solution:** Maintain a 3-year "Cash Buffer" in RDPU (Bibit) to avoid selling stocks during a bad year for the USD or the Market.

---

## 5. Sequence of Returns Risk (SRR)
SRR is the danger that the timing of market returns will destroy your portfolio.
- **Bad Sequence:** Market crashes -20% in Year 1 of retirement. You withdraw 4%. Total portfolio down -24%. It's hard to recover from this.
- **Good Sequence:** Market goes up +20% in Year 1. You withdraw 4%. Total portfolio up +16%.
- **Mitigation:** Two years before retirement, move 5% of your portfolio to cash every year to build a **Safety Net**.

---

## 6. Legacy & Estate Planning (The "Final" Hedge)
A professional plan includes what happens when you are no longer the manager.
- **Documentation:** Ensure your spouse/heirs know how to access Gotrade, Stockbit, and Bibit.
- **Insurance:** Use Term Life Insurance to cover your "Human Capital" value while you are young. Once your Financial Capital is large enough, you can "Self-Insure" and cancel the policy.

---

## 7. Psychological Transitions
- **The "Scarcity to Abundance" Shift:** It is hard for someone who spent 30 years saving to suddenly start spending. 
- **The "Identity" Shift:** As a Software Engineer, your identity is often tied to your work. Retirement requires a new "Job": being a Professional Capital Allocator.

---

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Underestimating Longevity:** Planning to live until 80 when you might live until 95. Your capital must last as long as you do.
- **Ignoring the "Glide Path":** Staying 90% in Crypto at age 60 because it's "worked for 20 years."
- **Home Country Over-allocation:** Keeping 100% of retirement funds in IDR. Maintain a significant USD/Global exposure to protect against local currency devaluation.

## 9. Implementation Guide
1. Determine your current "Life Stage" based on the decades above.
2. Check if your current allocation matches the "Suggested Allocation."
3. Calculate your "Projected Retirement Date" using a compound interest calculator based on your monthly IDR 7.2M contribution.
