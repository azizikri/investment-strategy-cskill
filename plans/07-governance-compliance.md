# Module 07: Investment Policy & Governance
**Document Version:** 1.2.0
**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. The Governance Mandate
Governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by which your investment activities are directed and controlled. For an institutional-grade personal portfolio, the **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** is the constitution. It prevents "Style Drift" and emotional decision-making during market turbulence. Without governance, an investor is just a speculator.

## 2. Comprehensive IPS Template (Case Study)
*This example is designed for a Software Engineer with a moderate-aggressive risk profile.*

### A. Purpose & Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** To achieve a long-term (20-year) annualized return of **10-12% (in USD terms)**.
- **Secondary Objective:** To maintain a liquid reserve that ensures zero debt is ever required for emergencies.
- **Spending Policy:** No withdrawals from the portfolio for discretionary spending until the Financial Independence (FI) number is reached.

### B. Risk Constraints
- **Maximum Drawdown:** 25% on a total portfolio basis.
- **Liquidity Requirement:** 10% of the portfolio must be accessible within 48 hours.
- **Single Asset Limit:** No satellite position may exceed 10% of total assets at cost.
- **Leverage Policy:** No margin or borrowed money allowed for investment purposes.

### C. Asset Allocation Policy (SAA)
- **Equities (Core):** 60% (VTI, VXUS, IDX30)
- **Equities (Satellite):** 30% (Individual Tech/Growth)
- **Alternatives:** 10% (Bitcoin, Gold)

### D. Rebalancing Guidelines
- **Frequency:** Semi-annual (June & December).
- **Trigger:** +/- 5% relative weight deviation.
- **Priority:** Use monthly salary (IDR 7.2M) to buy underweight assets first to minimize selling fees and tax events.

## 3. Documentation & Audit Trail
An institution must be able to explain *why* it made a trade to its board of directors. You are both the manager and the board.

### A. The "Decision Log"
For every major change (adding/removing a satellite), you must record:
1.  **Date and Price.**
2.  **The Trigger:** (e.g., "Earnings surprise," "Technical breakout," "Macro shift").
3.  **The Confidence Level:** (Scale 1-10).
4.  **The Counter-Argument:** What could be wrong with this decision?

### B. Annual Compliance Review
Every January, perform a "Compliance Audit":
- [ ] Did I exceed any risk limits this year?
- [ ] Did I follow the rebalancing rules?
- [ ] Are all W-8BEN forms up to date?
- [ ] Have I accounted for all dividend taxes in my SPT (Annual Tax Return)?

## 4. Succession & Inheritance Planning
What happens if you can no longer manage the portfolio?
1.  **The "Key Man" Risk:** You are the key manager. Your heirs need a map.
2.  **The Instruction Letter:** Create a document that lists every platform (Gotrade, Bibit, Stockbit), the type of assets held, and how to liquidate them in an emergency.
3.  **The "Sell Everything" Trigger:** If your heirs are not interested in active investing, instruct them to liquidate the Satellites and move everything into the Core (VTI/IDX30).
4.  **Legal designations:** Ensure "Beneficiary" forms are filled out on every platform to avoid long probate processes in Indonesia.

## 5. Advanced Tax Optimization (Indonesian Context)
As an Indonesian Software Engineer investing on global platforms, tax efficiency is a major "Alpha" generator.

### A. The US-Indonesia Tax Treaty (W-8BEN)
- **Standard US Withholding:** 30%.
- **Treaty Rate:** 15% on dividends.
- **Optimization:** Always ensure your Gotrade/Interactive Brokers W-8BEN is valid. Re-file every 3 years.

### B. Asset Location Strategy
"Asset Location" is about putting the right assets in the right tax buckets.
- **Reksadana (Bibit):** Since Reksadana is not a tax object in Indonesia for the investor, use it for your high-turnover strategies (like Momentum or Fixed Income) to avoid the 0.1% transaction taxes or complex capital gains reporting.
- **Domestic Stocks (Stockbit):** Best for long-term dividend "Compounders" since the 10% dividend tax can be waived if reinvested for 3 years.

## 6. Ethics & Professional Standards
1.  **Independence:** Do not follow "Finfluencers" blindly. Perform your own Module 03 analysis.
2.  **Integrity:** Never trade on material non-public information (Insider Trading).
3.  **Transparency:** Share your strategy with your partner/spouse. Financial secrets are a risk to the framework's stability.
4.  **Accountability:** If a trade fails, do not blame "The Market" or "The Fed." Blame your process and fix it.

---

## 7. Review Cycles: The Governance Rhythm
- **Monthly (Operational):** Allocate IDR 7.2M. Check for stop-loss triggers.
- **Quarterly (Tactical):** Perform **Performance Attribution** (Module 06). Review all active theses.
- **Annually (Strategic):** Update the IPS. Perform a full Net Worth audit. Calculate your **FI (Financial Independence) %**.

## 8. Key Takeaways
> - **Governance is the "Sober" you** making rules for the "Emotional" you.
> - **An IPS** is useless if it's not followed during a crash.
> - **Succession Planning** is the final act of a professional manager.

## 9. Implementation Guide
1. Create a "Governance" file in your notes app.
2. Fill out the IPS template above with your specific targets.
3. Check the expiration date of your W-8BEN on your global broker.
4. Draft a "Succession Instruction Letter" for your family.
