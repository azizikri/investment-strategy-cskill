# Module 05: Professional Trading Workflow
**Document Version:** 1.2.0
**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. The Workflow Mandate
In institutional trading, the difference between a professional and an amateur is not the "hot tip"—it is the **Process**. A professional follows a repeatable, audited workflow that removes emotion from decision-making. Trading is 10% analysis and 90% discipline.

## 2. Pre-Trade Phase: The Idea Pipeline
Ideas should come from a systematic screen, not from social media or news headlines.

### A. The "Funnel" Screening Process
1.  **Universe:** Start with 1,000 stocks (S&P 500 + IDX Top 100).
2.  **Filter 1 (Quality):** Only those with ROIC > 15% and Debt/EBITDA < 2.0. (Remaining: 200).
3.  **Filter 2 (Growth):** Only those with 3-year Revenue CAGR > 15%. (Remaining: 50).
4.  **Filter 3 (Technical):** Only those with Price > 200-day Moving Average. (Remaining: 15).
5.  **Filter 4 (Deep DD):** Perform Module 03 analysis on these 15.

### B. The 1-Page Investment Thesis
Every satellite trade must have a written thesis. If you can't explain why you are buying in one page, you don't understand the trade.
- **The Core Thesis:** "I am buying X because the market is underestimating its growth in the Y sector."
- **Specific Targets:** "I will take profit at IDR Z and exit if it hits IDR W."

## 3. Trade Execution: Strategic Order Management
Retail traders use "Market" orders; Professionals use "Limit" and "Algo" orders.

### A. Order Type Strategy
- **Limit Orders:** Always set your buy price at the "Bid" or "Mid" price. Never pay the "Ask" unless the momentum is vertical.
- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):** If you are building a large position (e.g., investing a whole year's bonus), don't buy all at once. Spread it over 2-3 days using small limit orders to avoid "Price Impact."
- **Stop-Loss Placement:** Place your stop-loss **at the same time** you place your buy order. This removes the "choice" to stay in a losing trade later.

### B. Entry Strategy: The "Three-Tranche" Entry
Instead of buying 100% at once:
1.  **Tranche 1 (25%):** Enter on the initial thesis.
2.  **Tranche 2 (50%):** Enter once the price confirms the trend (e.g., breaks a resistance level).
3.  **Tranche 3 (25%):** Enter on the first "Pullback" to the 50-day Moving Average.

## 4. Post-Trade: The Audit & Journal
A trade is not finished when the buy is executed.

### A. The Trade Journal
Record the "Why" and the "How."
- *Entry:* "Bought $BBCA because earnings beat expectations. Feeling confident."
- *Exit:* "Sold $BBCA because revenue growth slowed. Feeling annoyed that I missed the peak."
- **Analysis:** Looking at these notes later helps you identify if your emotions (Anxiety/Greed) are hurting your returns.

### B. Post-Mortem Analysis
For every trade that loses >5%, perform a "Post-Mortem":
1.  **Was it a "Bad Process" or "Bad Luck"?** (Bad process: forgot to check the earnings date. Bad luck: a global pandemic started).
2.  **Could I have exited earlier?** (Did the technicals show a trend break before the stop was hit?).
3.  **What will I do differently next time?**

## 5. The Trader's Psychology: Managing "The Gap"
The "Gap" is the space between your analysis and your execution. Emotion lives in this gap.

### A. The Four Stages of a Trade
1.  **Optimism:** When you find the idea. (Danger: Confirmation Bias).
2.  **Anxiety:** When the trade is live and moves against you. (Danger: Panic Selling).
3.  **Euphoria:** When the trade is up 20%. (Danger: Greed/Ignoring Stops).
4.  **Regret:** After you sell. (Danger: Revenge Trading).

**Institutional Solution:** Use "If-Then" rules. "IF price reaches X, THEN I will sell 50%."

## 6. Daily & Weekly Routines (The "Drumbeat")
### Daily Routine (06:00 - 08:30 WIB)
- **Global Context:** Check the S&P 500 close, US 10-Year Yield, and Brent Oil.
- **Portfolio Health:** Check for any "Stop-Loss" triggers.
- **News Scan:** Check "Investor Relations" pages for your Top 5 holdings.

### Weekly Routine (Sunday 19:00 WIB)
- **Watchlist Update:** Re-run the filters in Section 2.
- **Capital Allocation:** Decide how the upcoming month's IDR 7.2M salary will be distributed.
- **Macro Review:** Is the USD/IDR rate favorable for buying US stocks this week?

## 7. Mitigating Cognitive Biases
The workflow is designed to fight your brain's natural flaws:
1.  **Loss Aversion:** We hate losing $100 more than we like winning $100. *Solution: Automatic Stop-Losses.*
2.  **Hindsight Bias:** "I knew that was going to happen." *Solution: The Written Thesis.*
3.  **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking only good news about our stocks. *Solution: The "Bear Case" section in the thesis.*
4.  **Recency Bias:** Thinking the future will look exactly like the last 3 months. *Solution: SAA (Strategic Asset Allocation).*

## 8. Institutional Investment Committee (IC) Protocol
For any trade larger than 5% of your net worth, simulate an IC meeting:
- Present your 1-page thesis to a trusted peer (or even a sophisticated AI).
- Ask them to find 3 reasons why the trade will fail.
- If you can't refute those 3 reasons, **do not make the trade.**

---

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Checking Prices Every Hour:** This leads to emotional over-trading. Check once a day at most.
- **"Average Down" on Losers:** Never add more money to a position that is hitting new lows unless the fundamental thesis has *improved* at the lower price. Usually, it's better to "Average Up" on winners.
- **Trading on "Tips":** If someone tells you a stock is a "guaranteed 10x," they are either lying or already own it and want to sell it to you.

## 10. Implementation Guide
1. Choose one stock you currently own.
2. Write a 1-page "Post-Investment Thesis" for it today.
3. Set a "Hard Stop" for that stock in your broker app.
