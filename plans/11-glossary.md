## The Institutional Investment Encyclopedia

### A
- **Alpha:** The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index. It represents the "value-add" of an active manager. If the S&P 500 returns 10% and your portfolio returns 12%, your Alpha is 2%. *Institutional Perspective: Alpha is extremely difficult to find consistently. Most managers who claim to have Alpha are actually just taking "Hidden Beta" (more risk).*
- **Altman Z-Score:** A combination of five financial ratios used to estimate the probability that a company will go bankrupt within two years. A score above 3.0 is considered safe. *Institutional Perspective: This is a critical screening tool for Value investors to avoid "Value Traps" that are heading for insolvency.*
- **ADR (American Depositary Receipt):** A certificate issued by a U.S. bank that represents shares in foreign stock, allowing U.S. investors to buy shares in foreign companies easily. *Institutional Perspective: Be aware of "Currency Risk" and "Withholding Taxes" on dividends for ADRs, as they follow the home country's tax laws.*
- **ATR (Average True Range):** A volatility indicator that shows how much an asset moves, on average, during a given time frame. It is used to set volatility-adjusted stop losses. *Institutional Perspective: Professional traders never set stops at "round numbers" like 10%. They set them based on the ATR to avoid being "shaken out" by market noise.*
- **Accretive:** An acquisition or investment that increases the per-share earnings of the purchasing company. *Institutional Perspective: Analysts watch acquisitions closely to see if they are "accretive" or "dilutive." A dilutive acquisition usually leads to a stock price drop.*
- **Asset Allocation:** The process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. It is the single most important factor in long-term returns. *Institutional Perspective: 90% of your long-term returns are determined by your asset allocation, not your individual stock picks.*
- **Arbitrage:** The simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price. It is considered a risk-free profit. *Institutional Perspective: In modern high-frequency trading, arbitrage opportunities exist for only milliseconds.*
- **Accumulation Phase:** The period in an investor's life when they are working and building their investment portfolio. *Institutional Perspective: During this phase, your greatest asset is your "Human Capital" (future earnings), not your current bank balance.*
- **Amortization:** The process of gradually writing off the initial cost of an intangible asset over its useful life.
- **Ask Price:** The lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security.
- **Agency Risk:** The risk that a company's management will act in their own best interests (e.g., high bonuses) rather than in the best interests of the shareholders. *Institutional Perspective: We mitigate this by looking for "Skin in the Game"—CEOs who own a large percentage of the stock.*

### B
- **Beta:** A measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1.2 means the stock is 20% more volatile than the market. *Institutional Perspective: Low-beta stocks often outperform high-beta stocks over the long run on a risk-adjusted basis (The Low-Vol Anomaly).*
- **Basis Point (bps):** One-hundredth of one percent (0.01%). Used to describe changes in interest rates or yields. 100 bps equals 1%. *Institutional Perspective: Institutions fight over 5-10 bps in execution costs. For a retail investor, 100 bps (1%) in fees can destroy your compounding over 30 years.*
- **Blue Chip:** A nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company with a history of reliable earnings and dividends.
- **Bottom-Up Investing:** An investment approach that focuses on the analysis of individual stocks rather than macroeconomic cycles.
- **Bear Market:** A market condition in which prices are falling or are expected to fall (usually defined as a 20% drop from recent peaks). *Institutional Perspective: Bear markets are when "Wealth is transferred from the impatient to the patient." They are essential for long-term health as they clear out "zombie" companies.*
- **Bull Market:** A market condition in which prices are rising or are expected to rise.
- **Book Value:** The net asset value of a company, calculated by total assets minus intangible assets (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. *Institutional Perspective: Book value is becoming less relevant in the digital age, as "Intangible Assets" (code, brands) are not fully captured.*
- **Bid Price:** The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security.
- **Bid-Ask Spread:** The difference between the highest price a buyer will pay and the lowest price a seller will accept. *Institutional Perspective: Wide spreads are a sign of "Illiquidity." Avoid trading assets with wide spreads during high-volatility events.*
- **Bond:** A fixed-income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental).
- **Benchmark:** A standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund, or investment manager can be measured. *Institutional Perspective: If you aren't beating your benchmark over 3 years, you should switch to a passive index fund.*

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** Funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, plants, or equipment. *Institutional Perspective: High CapEx is a burden. We prefer "Asset Light" businesses that can grow without massive spending.*
- **Cost of Capital:** The required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile.
- **Correlation:** A statistic that measures the degree to which two securities move in relation to each other. Values range from -1.0 to +1.0. *Institutional Perspective: During a "Liquidity Crisis," correlations often go to 1.0 (everything falls together). True diversification requires assets that are fundamentally different (e.g., Stocks vs. Gold).*
- **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):** The amount of money a company brings in from its regular business activities.
- **Contrarian Investing:** An investment style that goes against prevailing market trends (buying when others are selling). *Institutional Perspective: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." — Warren Buffett.*

- **Common Stock:** A security that represents ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock elect the board of directors and vote on corporate policies.

- **Credit Rating:** An assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower in general terms or with respect to a particular debt or financial obligation.

### D
- **DCF (Discounted Cash Flow):** A valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, discounted back to their present value. *Institutional Perspective: A DCF is only as good as its assumptions. Small changes in the "Discount Rate" can lead to massive changes in the valuation.*
- **Drawdown:** The peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment, fund, or deposit account. It is a measure of historical risk.
- **Dividend Yield:** A financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. *Institutional Perspective: High dividend yields (>8%) are often a "warning sign" that the market expects a dividend cut.*

- **Day Trading:** The practice of buying and selling a financial instrument within the same trading day. *Institutional Perspective: Statistical evidence shows that >95% of individual day traders lose money over a 5-year period. This framework avoids day trading.*
