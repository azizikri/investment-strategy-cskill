# Module 04: Portfolio Architecture
**Document Version:** 1.3.0
**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. The Institutional Portfolio Mandate
A professional portfolio is not just a "basket of stocks." It is a carefully engineered system designed to deliver specific risk-adjusted returns across multiple market cycles. We use the **Core-Satellite Model** to marry the reliability of indexing with the upside of active selection.

## 2. The Core (60-70% of Portfolio)
The Core is your wealth-preservation engine. It should consist of high-liquidity, low-cost assets that track the global economy.

### A. Recommended ETF Selection (Gotrade/Bibit)
- **VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market):** Exposure to 3,500+ US companies. The ultimate "Beta" play.
- **VXUS (Vanguard Total International Stock):** Exposure to non-US markets (Europe, Japan, Emerging Markets).
- **IDX30 / LQ45 (Bibit):** Your domestic exposure to Indonesia's top 30-45 companies.
- **SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equity):** For a "Quality" and "Yield" tilt.
- **BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market):** For stability and income during market downturns.

### B. Core Weighting Strategy
A standard "Aggressive" core for an Indonesian Software Engineer:
- 50% **VTI** (US Growth)
- 15% **VXUS** (Global Diversification)
- 20% **IDX30** (Domestic Stability)
- 10% **RDPU** (Cash/Bibit Liquidity)
- 5% **Gold/GLD** (Inflation Hedge)

## 3. The Satellite (30-40% of Portfolio)
This is where you seek **Alpha**. You only add a satellite if you have a high-conviction thesis that it will outperform the Core.

### A. Satellite Selection Rules
1.  **Concentration:** Hold no more than 8-12 satellite positions. Too many leads to "Diworsification."
2.  **Uncorrelated Risks:** If you own Apple, don't buy Microsoft as another satellite. They are too correlated. Buy something in a different sector (e.g., Energy or Healthcare).
3.  **Maximum Size:** No single satellite position should ever exceed 10% of your *total* portfolio.

## 4. Market Regimes: Sailing with the Wind
Institutional investors adjust their portfolio "tilt" based on the economic regime.

### A. The Four Quadrants of Growth & Inflation
1.  **High Growth / Low Inflation (The Goldilocks):** Best for Growth Stocks and Tech. (Tilt: Overweight $QQQ).
2.  **High Growth / High Inflation:** Best for Commodities and Value Stocks. (Tilt: Overweight $ADRO, $INCO).
3.  **Low Growth / Low Inflation (Deflationary):** Best for Bonds and Defensive Stocks. (Tilt: Overweight $SCHD, $BND).
4.  **Low Growth / High Inflation (Stagflation):** Best for Gold and Cash. (Tilt: Overweight $GLD).

**Action:** Review the macro environment quarterly. If the Fed is raising rates to fight inflation, move your Satellite tilt from Quadrant 1 to Quadrant 2.

## 5. Currency Hedging: Managing the USD/IDR Risk
As an Indonesian investor, your largest "Hidden Risk" is currency.
- **Scenario A:** Your US stocks go up 10%, but the IDR strengthens 10%. Your net return is **ZERO**.
- **Scenario B:** Your US stocks stay flat, but the IDR weakens 10%. You just made **10%** in IDR terms.
- **Institutional Strategy:** 
    - When USD/IDR is "cheap" (<15,000), move IDR aggressively into USD assets (Gotrade).
    - When USD/IDR is "expensive" (>16,000), keep more of your new salary in IDR assets (Bibit) to avoid buying the USD at a peak.

## 6. Asset Allocation Frameworks (The "Sails")
### A. Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)
This is your "Default" setting. It only changes when your life stage changes (e.g., getting married or approaching retirement).

### B. Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)
This is a short-term move (1-6 months) to take advantage of market extremes.
- *Example:* If the Nasdaq (QQQ) has an RSI > 80 (Extreme Overbought), you might tactically move 5% from Satellite to Cash until the RSI drops back to 50.

---

## 7. Rebalancing: The Mathematics of "Selling High"
Rebalancing is a contrarian act. It forces you to sell the things that have done well and buy the things that have done poorly.

### A. Case Study: The 2022 Tech Correction
- **Jan 2022:** Your US Tech (Satellite) grew to 50% of your portfolio (Target was 30%).
- **The Move:** You sell the 20% excess and buy IDR Bonds/Gold (which were flat).
- **Result:** When Tech crashed -30% in mid-2022, your portfolio only fell a fraction of that, and you had cash ready to buy the bottom.

### B. Threshold Rebalancing (The "5% Rule")
Don't rebalance on a calendar (e.g., "Every January"). Rebalance when an asset is out of place.
- **Trigger:** If target is 20% and current is 25.1%, rebalance.

## 8. Correlation Analysis: The Only Free Lunch
To reduce risk without reducing returns, you must find assets with **Negative Correlation**.

| Asset A | Asset B | Correlation | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S&P 500** | **US Dollars (Cash)** | -0.60 | When stocks crash, people rush to USD. |
| **US Stocks** | **Gold** | -0.20 | Gold is a "Fear" asset. |
| **Tech Stocks** | **Oil/Energy** | -0.10 | Energy often does well during inflation when Tech struggles. |

## 9. The Efficient Frontier & Optimization
We use the **Sharpe Ratio** to judge if the complexity of our portfolio is worth it.
- **Sharpe < 1.0:** You are taking too much risk for the return. Consider moving more to the Core.
- **Sharpe > 1.5:** You have a well-balanced portfolio.
- **Sharpe > 2.0:** You have achieved institutional-grade optimization.

## 10. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Chasing the Core:** Selling your Index funds to buy a "Hot" satellite stock. This breaks the foundation.
- **Ignoring Expenses:** A 1% expense ratio on a fund might not seem like much, but over 30 years, it can eat 30% of your total gains. Stick to low-cost ETFs.
- **Over-allocation to Crypto:** While Crypto has high Alpha potential, its volatility makes it a Satellite only. Never let it become the Core.

## 11. Implementation Guide
1. Export your current holdings into a spreadsheet.
2. Label each as "Core" or "Satellite."
3. Calculate your current Core/Satellite ratio. (Target: 70/30).
4. Use your next IDR 7.2M paycheck to "Buy the Gap" to get back to your target.
